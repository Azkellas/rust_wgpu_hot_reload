Hot reload both shaders and rust code while developing a WGPU application with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) integration.

Package a single binary/wasm for native and web targets.

---

### Features

- build to native and wasm
- hot reload shader (instant), embed shader files in release and wasm builds
- hot reload rust (~4sec to rebuild and relink library)
- hot reload ui with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) integration
- shader preprocessor
  - `#import "file.wgsl"`

---

### Running the project

To have both shader and rust hot reload, run:
  - `cargo run --features reload` in one terminal
  - `cargo watch -w lib -x "rustc --crate-type=dylib -p lib"` in another terminal. (requires [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch))

Alternatively use `cargo runcc -c runcc.yml` to run both commands at the same time. (requires [cargo-runcc](https://crates.io/crates/runcc))

You can also run `cargo run` if you only care about shader hot reloading. 

`cargo run --release` as usual to build a single executable for your native target. For `wasm` builds, see below.

---

### Building for the web

This project targets webgpu first, and defaults to webgl when not available. 
```sh
# In charge of building and hosting a webserver. Should expose to localhost:8000
cargo run-wasm [--release] [--features ...]
```

---

### Wgsl preprocessing

This project contains a small homemade preprocessor for wgsl files.
It currently allows to include other files by using `#import "path/to/file.wgsl"` in your shader files.

This syntax follows the bevy preprocessor syntax, which is roughly supported by wgsl-analyzer.

--- 

### Using the template

The project comes with a `PipelineFuncs` trait. Hopefully it should be enough for your needs. You just need to replace the current implementation with yours in `lib/lib.rs`: `demo_pipelines::demo::Pipeline as CurrentPipeline;`.


---

### Project architecture

The project is divided in two crates: `lib` and `src`.

`src` should only contain the minimal code necessary to start the application and the windowing system,
allowing a maximum of code to be hot-reloaded in `lib` which is built as a dynamic library and reloaded at runtime whenever changes are saved.

Entry point functions should be written in `lib/src/lib.rs`, be public and have the `#[no_mangle]` attribute to be hot-reloadable.
Note that they cannot be generic. Example:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub fn get_pipeline_name(pipeline: &CurrentPipeline) -> String {
    pipeline.get_name().to_owned()
}
```

Then each use of the `lib` in `src` should be done via the module `hot_lib::library_bridge` that makes the bridge between the binary and the dynamic library.

See [hot-lib-reloader-rs](https://github.com/rksm/hot-lib-reloader-rs) for more information about hot reloading Rust code and its limitations.

### Troubleshooting

- Since the wasm and native targets use different flags, switching from one target to the other takes time as many dependencies need to be rebuilt.
Be careful to set rust-analyzer to the same target you're building to, otherwise they will compete against each other and create a lot of unnecessary recompiling.

- Rust requires the dylib to be present at compile time to link, so starting the hot-reload mode with runcc can crash if the bin finishes compiling when the no dll/so is present yet.
In which case you just have to let the library finish building in dynamic mode and restart runcc.

- wgpu does not use the idiomatic rust way `Error` to handle errors. See [here](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/3767) for more info, or have a look at `shader_build.rs::ShaderBuilder::create_module` for an example.
